## Evozon Core

This module is intended to overwrite/extend Magento's core modules in order to fix common problems.

## Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/frozenminds/magento_core.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/frozenminds/magento_core)

### Important

 - This module should never have a project specific fix or feature. Only common problems need to be fixed here.
 - Document every fix/update in the separate `UPDATES.md` file.
 - Always test code against multiple environments and make sure it doesn't break any other functionality.
